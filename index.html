<p align="justify">Lysine methylation is a covalent post-translational modification (PTM) contributing to all aspects of cell biology, and which deregulation often leads to human pathologies such as cancer.</p> <br> 
<p align="justify">Our group exists since 2017 and was officially created in 2023 as an emerging team from the Institute for Advanced Biosciences, in the great surroundings of Grenoble, FRANCE.</p> <br>
