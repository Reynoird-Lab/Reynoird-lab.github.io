	  <p align="justify"> July 2022: We are extremely proud to have our work published in the journal Cancer Discovery! It is already online and can be found here: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-21-0205 "style="color:DARKSLATEGRAY;"> SMYD3 impedes small cell lung cancer sensitivity to alkylation damage through RNF113A methylation-phosphorylation crosstalk</a> <br > A great study resulting from the effort of Gael Roth and Valentina Lukinovic and the collaboration with the N. Mosammapaprast and the P. Mazur labs, in which we demonstrate SMYD3 impacts on SCLC tolerance to alkylating chemotherapy. The final edited version is now online and the print issue version is out on September 2nd 2022.</p>

  <div class="paragraph-right"><p align="justify"> Our lab is co-organizing an exciting meeting with the Weitzman lab on the 27th & 28th of October in Paris. Mark your agenda!
	  <br > <br > It will be dedicated to  protein methylation signaling functions broader than histone and chromatin regulation. We are delighted to have fantastic keynote speakers such as Or Gozani (Stanford University), Cheryl Arrowsmith (Toronto University), Yang Shi (Oxford University), Clare Davies (Birmingham University), Pal Falnes (Oslo University), and many others! 
	    <br > Registration is free but compulsory (for organization purpose). There will be several short talks for invited speakers and 2 poster sessions, so don't hesitate to submit an abstract.
