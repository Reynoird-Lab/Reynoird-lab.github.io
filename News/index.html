And what a fantastic accomplishment for the lab, who ended up the meeting with 3 prizes: Tanveer with a best poster prize (well deserved, as he was restless presenting all meeting long!), Ludivine with a travel award (while braving a cold, no luck!) and Nicolas with a best young oral presentation prize (very happy to still be considered young)! Looking forward to all the future collaborations coming from this meeting and to the next 2026 edition. </p>
